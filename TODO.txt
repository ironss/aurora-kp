Lots of things to do with the Munin installation

* Combine all of those nexeo_ plugins into a single multigraph plugin

* Move the astro, tides and  weather astro plugins to constanza

* Move the places into group 'Places' rather than their 

* Change the weather_ plugins to openweathermap_

    * and ensure that the data moves too

* Create a new weather_ plugin that borrows data from weatherkit_ and openweathermap_ plugins

    * this new plugin will not actually read data ('update no'), but will use 'graph_order'
      to borrow the data

* Think of a way to store secrets for weatherkit and openweathermap. Currently, stored in 
  /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weatherkit etc

* Think of a way to share location data between plugins, rather than copy-paste. Perhaps
  in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/locations as a JSON object? Perhaps somewhere in /usr/share?

* Generate weatherkit JWT on-the-fly, rather than using the 400-day token that I generated
  manually and stored in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weatherkit.

* Add data attribution

* Places of interest

    * Christchurch Airport
    * Lyttelton Port
    * Nelson Airport
    * Port Nelson
    * Greymouth
    * Auckland Airport

    * Wichita, KA, US

    * Scott Base
    * SANAE IV
    * Amundsen-Scott Polar Station
    * other Antarctic bases
