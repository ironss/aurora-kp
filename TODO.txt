Lots of things to do with the Munin installation

* Combine all of those nexeo_ plugins into a single multigraph plugin

* Move the plugins to constanza

    * astro
    * tides
    * weather

* [DONE] Move the places into group 'Places' rather than their domain suffix.

* Change the weather_ plugins to openweathermap_

    * and ensure that the data moves too

* Create a new weather_ plugin that borrows data from weatherkit_ and openweathermap_ plugins

    * this new plugin will not actually read data ('update no'), but will use 'graph_order'
      to borrow the data

* Think of a way to store secrets for weatherkit and openweathermap. Currently, stored in 
  /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weatherkit etc

* Think of a way to share location data between plugins, rather than copy-paste. Perhaps
  in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/locations as a JSON object? Perhaps somewhere in /usr/share?

* Generate weatherkit JWT on-the-fly, rather than using the 400-day token that I generated
  manually and stored in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weatherkit.

* [DONE] Add data attribution

* Places of interest

    [X] Christchurch Airport -- just 'Christchurch'
    [X] Lyttelton Port
    [X] Nelson Airport -- Just 'Nelson'
    [ ] Port Nelson -- just 'Nelson'
    [ ] Greymouth
    [ ] Auckland Airport

    [X] Wichita, KA, US

    [X] Scott Base
    [X] SANAE IV
    [X] Amundsen-Scott Polar Station
    [X] other Antarctic bases    



Notes

To move RRD files
-----------------

* Hard-link the RRD file(s) to the new place -- how do you know what they should be? Use your brain...

* Adjust the Munin configuration

* Restart Munin -- wait until 1 minute before the next cycle.

* Remove the RRD file(s) from the old place.
