Munin plugins to retrieve online weather forecasts, etc

* Weather forecasts from OpenWeatherMap
* Weather forecasts from Apple WeatherKit
* Solar Kp index forecast from NOAA


Files
=====

* weather.py        retrieve current weather from a service provider and create 
  a standard weather report
  
* weather_owm.py    settings for OpenWeatherMap
* weather_awk.py    settings for Apple WeatherKit

* weather_          Munin plugin to present weather from multiple providers
* weather_owm_      Munin plugin to retrieve weather from OpenWeatherMap
* weather_awk_      Munin plugin to retrieve weather from Apple WeatherKit

* /etc/munin/plugins/openweathermap
* /etc/munin/plugins/weatherkit
                    Configuration files to specify secrets, etc
                    Note that these are restricted access, so relatively
                    safe from casual snooping


OpenWeatherMap
==============

* Create an account with OpenWeatherMap

* Create an API key

* Modify the configuration file /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weather_owm

* Create and/or modify the locations file locations.json

* Symlink the Munin plugin as required for each location


WeatherKit
==========

* See instructions on Apple Developer website to 

    * register for Apple WeatherKit
    
    * generate a private key

* Create a long-lasting JWT

    * TODO: generate JWT from the private key on-the-fly

* Modify the configuration file /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weather_owm

* Create and/or modify the locations file locations.json

* Symlink the Munin plugin as required for each location



TODO
====

* Combine all of those nexeo_ plugins into a single multigraph plugin

* Move the plugins to constanza

    * astro
    * tides
    * weather

* [DONE] Move the places into group 'Places' rather than their domain suffix.

* [DONE] Change the weather_ plugins to openweathermap_

    * [CANCELLED] and ensure that the data moves too -- only 3 or 4 days, so just abandoned the weather data

* [DONE] Create a new weather_ plugin that borrows data from weatherkit_ and openweathermap_ plugins

    * [DONE] this new plugin will not actually read data ('update no'), but will use 'graph_order'
      to borrow the data

* [CANCELLED] Think of a way to store secrets for weatherkit and openweathermap. Currently, stored in 
  /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weatherkit etc

* [DONE] Think of a way to share location data between plugins

    * stored in /var/lib/munin/locations.json

* Generate weatherkit JWT on-the-fly, rather than using the 400-day token that I generated
  manually and stored in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/weatherkit.

* [DONE] Add data attribution

* [DONE] Places of interest

    [X] Christchurch -- weather: airport
    [X] Lyttelton -- weather:port, tides: port
    [X] Nelson -- weather: airport, tide:port
    [ ] Greymouth
    [ ] Auckland

    [X] Wichita, KA, US -- weather

    [X] Scott Base -- weather
    [X] SANAE IV -- weather
    [X] Amundsen-Scott Polar Station -- weather
    [ ] other Antarctic bases
